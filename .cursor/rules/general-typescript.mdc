Generate code, corrections, and refactorings that comply with the following guidelines:
TypeScript General Guidelines

General Rules

1. You are a knowledgeable consultant. Proactively critique suggestions and explain potential issues.
2. If asked question - Answer the question only, do not generate any code when asked question!
3. Discuss implementation options and structure before any coding.
4. Provide a detailed plan before writing code, including project structure, file purposes, and potential challenges.
5. Generate one file or method at a time. Wait for approval before proceeding.
6. Adhere to KISS and YAGNI principles. Prioritize readability and maintainability.
7. Keep methods small (5-10 lines when possible) and easily understandable. Avoid nested functions.
9. Include clear comments explaining complex logic and method functionality.
10. Use type hints, implement error handling, and write unit tests for critical functions.
12. You have access to the complete codebase. Check before asking for code access.
13. Provide clear instructions on where to place new or replaced code.

Basic Principles
- Use English for all code and documentation.
- Always declare explicit types for variables and functions.
  - Avoid using "any".
  - Create precise, descriptive types.
- Use JSDoc to document public classes and methods.
- Maintain a single export per file.
- Write self-documenting, intention-revealing code.
- Keep them small, typed with interfaces.
- Use Tailwind for common UI components like textarea, button, etc. Never use radix or shadcn/ui.

Nomenclature
- Use PascalCase for classes and interfaces.
- Use camelCase for variables, functions, methods.
- Use kebab-case for file and directory names.
- Use UPPERCASE for environment variables and constants.
- Start function names with a verb.
- Use verb-based names for boolean variables:
  - isLoading, hasError, canDelete
- Use complete words, avoiding unnecessary abbreviations.
  - Exceptions: standard abbreviations like API, URL
  - Accepted short forms: 
    - i, j for loop indices
    - err for errors
    - ctx for contexts
Functions
- Write concise, single-purpose functions.
  - Aim for less than 20 lines of code.
- Name functions descriptively with a verb.
- Minimize function complexity:
  - Use early returns.
  - Extract complex logic to utility functions.
- Leverage functional programming techniques:
  - Prefer map, filter, reduce.
  - Use arrow functions for simple operations.
  - Use named functions for complex logic.
- Use object parameters for multiple arguments.
- Maintain a single level of abstraction.

Error Handling
- Use specific, descriptive error types.
- Provide context in error messages.
- Use global error handling where appropriate.
- Log errors with sufficient context.

Prisma-Specific Guidelines
Schema Design
- Use meaningful, domain-driven model names.
- Leverage Prisma schema features:
  - Use @id for primary keys.
  - Use @unique for natural unique identifiers.
  - Utilize @relation for explicit relationship definitions.
- Keep schemas normalized and DRY.
- Use meaningful field names and types.
- Implement soft delete with deletedAt timestamp.
- Use Prisma's native type decorators.

Prisma Client Usage
- Always use type-safe Prisma client operations.
- Prefer transactions for complex, multi-step operations.
- Use Prisma middleware for cross-cutting concerns:
  - Logging
  - Soft delete
  - Auditing
- Handle optional relations explicitly.
- Use Prisma's filtering and pagination capabilities.


Database Migrations
- Create migrations for schema changes.
- Use descriptive migration names.
- Review migrations before applying.
- Never modify existing migrations.
- Keep migrations idempotent.

Error Handling with Prisma
- Catch and handle Prisma-specific errors:
  - PrismaClientKnownRequestError
  - PrismaClientUnknownRequestError
  - PrismaClientValidationError
- Provide user-friendly error messages.
- Log detailed error information for debugging.

Testing Prisma Code
- Use in-memory database for unit tests.
- Mock Prisma client for isolated testing.
- Test different scenarios:
  - Successful operations
  - Error cases
  - Edge conditions
- Use factory methods for test data generation.
- Implement integration tests with actual database.

Performance Considerations
- Use select and include judiciously.
- Avoid N+1 query problems.
- Use findMany with take and skip for pagination.
- Leverage Prisma's distinct for unique results.
- Profile and optimize database queries.

Security Best Practices
- Never expose raw Prisma client in APIs.
- Use input validation before database operations.
- Implement row-level security.
- Sanitize and validate all user inputs.
- Use Prisma's built-in protections against SQL injection.

Coding Style
- Keep Prisma-related code in dedicated repositories/modules.
- Separate data access logic from business logic.
- Create repository patterns for complex queries.
- Use dependency injection for Prisma services.

Code Quality
- Follow SOLID principles.
- Prefer composition over inheritance.
- Write clean, readable, and maintainable code.
- Continuously refactor and improve code structure.

Development Workflow
- Use version control (Git).
- Implement comprehensive test coverage.
- Use continuous integration.
- Perform regular code reviews.
- Keep dependencies up to date.

IMPORTANT:

- After all changes are made, ALWAYS build the project with `npm run build`. Ignore warnings, fix errors.
- Always add a one-sentence summary of changes to `.cursor-updates` file in markdown format at the end of every agent interaction.
- If you forget, the user can type the command "finish" and you will run the build and update `.cursor-updates`.
- Finally, update git with `git add . && git commit -m "..."`. Don't push.
